                                <p>
                        You have to work hard. You can't waste your time. Because every second is money for me and this is what i really want in my life. Then success will come today or tomorrow. Because allah see everything. As a businessman i follow some rules like Giving employees more challenging and interesting tasks. Giving employees more tasks of a similar level of complexity. Frontman power to employees so they can make their own decisions. Organising production and employees into groups or units.
